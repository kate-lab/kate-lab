 <br />ğŸ‘‹&nbsp; Hi, Iâ€™m Kate Westbrook.
 <br />ğŸ‘€&nbsp; Iâ€™m interested in design, code and how people learn things.
 <br />ğŸ’ª&nbsp; background in project managing creative learning projects (Design Museum, RIBA, Bow Arts) and teaching.
 <br />ğŸŒ± &nbsp;Iâ€™m just beginning my coding journey - having just completed the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly.
 <br />ğŸŒ»&nbsp;  I'm looking for my first job as a software developer!
